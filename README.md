# HACKATHON - AM HACKS 2.0
CampusConnect is a group hackathon participation organised by ASSETMERKLE, IGDTUW.
My immediate role was to construct and work on the backend of the following project using databases and API systems.

Problem Statement
In colleges, academic communication depends on intermediaries, leading to delays, miscommunication, and missed updates. There is no single official platform for professors to directly share announcements, notes, schedules, and study resources with students. Doubt resolution is also scattered across informal channels, leaving no structured space for students to post doubts, get peer support, and receive verified responses from professors.
